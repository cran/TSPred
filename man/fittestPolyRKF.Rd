\title{Automatic fitting and prediction of polynomial regression with Kalman filter 
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The function predicts and returns the next n consecutive values of a univariate time series using the best evaluated polynomial regression model automatically fitted with Kalman filter. It also evaluates the fitness of the produced model, using AICc, AIC, BIC and logLik criteria, and its prediction accuracy, using the MSE, NMSE, MAPE, sMAPE and maximal error accuracy measures.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
fittestPolyRKF(timeseries, timeseries.test, maxorder = 5, na.action = na.omit,
se.fit = FALSE, filtered = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{timeseries}{A vector or univariate time series which contains the values used for fitting a polynomial regression model with Kalman filter.
%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries} here~~
}
  \item{timeseries.test}{A vector or univariate time series containing a continuation for \code{timeseries} with actual values. The number of consecutive values to be predicted is assumed to be equal to the length of \code{timeseries.test}. It is used as a testing set and base for calculation of prediction error measures.
%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries.cont} here~~
}
  \item{maxorder}{A numeric integer value corresponding to the maximal order of polynomial regression to be fitted and evaluated.
%%     ~~Describe \code{maxorder} here~~
}
  \item{na.action}{A function for treating missing values in \code{timeseries} and \code{timeseries.test}. The default function is \code{\link{na.omit}}, which omits any missing values found in \code{timeseries} or \code{timeseries.test}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{na.action} here~~
}
  \item{se.fit}{If \code{se.fit} is \code{TRUE}, the standard errors of the predictions are returned.
%%     ~~Describe \code{se.fit} here~~
}
  \item{filtered}{If \code{filtered} is \code{TRUE}, Kalman filtered time series observations are used for prediction, otherwise, Kalman smoothed observations are used for prediction.
%%     ~~Describe \code{filtered} here~~
}
}
\details{A set of maxorder+1 polynomial regression models of orders from 0 to \code{maxorder}, respectively, is generated and represented as state space models (\code{\link{SSModel}}) based on code from the \code{dlmodeler} package. See \code{\link[dlmodeler]{dlmodeler.polynomial}}.

All models in the set are optimized using the Kalman filter and functions of the \code{KFAS} package (see \code{\link{fitSSM}}). Different initial parameterization during the optimization process generate different models, which are included in the set of polynomial regression models to be evaluated.

The set of generated models are used for time series prediction. Fitness measures (AICc, AIC, BIC, log-likelihood) and prediction accuracy measures (MSE, NMSE, MAPE, sMAPE, maximal error) are calculated for each model.

The models are ranked and the best evaluated fitted polynomial regression model is selected based on the lowest value of the TSPredC criterion.

The TSPredC criterion is calculated as the sum of the rank possitions of a model (1 = 1st position = better ranked model, 2 = 2nd position, etc.) on each calculated fitness or prediction accuracy measure.
