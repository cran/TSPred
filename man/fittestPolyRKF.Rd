\title{Automatic fitting and prediction of polynomial regression with Kalman filter 
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The function predicts and returns the next n consecutive values of a univariate time series using the best evaluated polynomial regression model automatically fitted with Kalman filter. It also evaluates the fitness of the produced model, using AICc, AIC, BIC and logLik criteria, and its prediction accuracy, using the MSE, NMSE, MAPE, sMAPE and maximal error accuracy measures.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
fittestPolyRKF(timeseries, timeseries.test=NULL, h=NULL, na.action=na.omit,
level=0.9, order=NULL, minorder=0, maxorder=5, initQ=NULL, filtered = TRUE, 
rank.by=c("MSE","NMSE","MAPE","sMAPE","MaxError","AIC","AICc","BIC","logLik",

%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries.cont} here~~
}
  \item{h}{Number of consecutive values of the time series to be predicted. If \code{h} is \code{NULL}, the number of consecutive values to be predicted is assumed to be equal to the length of \code{timeseries.test}. Required when \code{timeseries.test} is \code{NULL}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{n.ahead} here~~
}
  \item{na.action}{A function for treating missing values in \code{timeseries} and \code{timeseries.test}. The default function is \code{\link{na.omit}}, which omits any missing values found in \code{timeseries} or \code{timeseries.test}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{na.action} here~~
}
  \item{level}{Confidence level for prediction intervals. See the \code{\link{predict.SSModel}} function in the \code{KFAS} package.
%%     ~~Describe \code{na.action} here~~
}
  \item{order}{A numeric integer value corresponding to the order of polynomial regression to be fitted. If \code{NULL}, the order of the polynomial regression returned by the function is automatically selected within the interval \code{minorder:maxorder}. See 'Details'.
%%     ~~Describe \code{maxorder} here~~
}
  \item{minorder}{A numeric integer value corresponding to the minimum order of candidate polynomial regression to be fitted and evaluated. Ignored if \code{order} is provided. See 'Details'.

%%     ~~Describe \code{filtered} here~~
}
  \item{initQ}{Numeric argument regarding the initial values for the covariance of disturbances parameter to be optimized over. The initial values to be optimized are set to \code{rep(initQ,(order+1))}. See the \code{Q} argument of the \code{\link{SSModel}} function in the \code{KFAS} package and the examples in \code{\link{KFAS}}. If \code{NULL}, \code{initQ} is automatically set. See 'Details'.
%%     ~~Describe \code{filtered} here~~
}
  \item{rank.by}{Character string. Criteria used for ranking candidate models generated using different options of values for \code{order} and/or \code{initQ}. Ignored if both \code{order} and \code{initQ} are provided. See 'Details'.

}
}
\details{The polynomial regression model produced and returned by the function is generated and represented as state space model (\code{\link{SSModel}}) based on code from the \code{dlmodeler} package. See \code{dlmodeler.polynomial}. The model is optimized using the Kalman filter and functions of the \code{KFAS} package (see \code{\link{fitSSM}}).

If \code{order} is \code{NULL}, it is automatically selected. For that, a set of candidate polynomial regression state space models of orders from \code{minorder} to \code{maxorder} is generated and evaluated. Also, if \code{initQ} is \code{NULL}, it is automatically set as either \code{log(var(timeseries))} or \code{0}. For that, candidate models receive different initial parameterization of \code{initQ} during the model optimization process. The value options of \code{order} and/or \code{initQ} which generate the best ranked candidate polynomial regression model acoording to the criteria in \code{rank.by} are selected.

The ranking criteria in \code{rank.by} may be set as a prediction error measure (such as \code{\link{MSE}}, \code{\link{NMSE}}, \code{\link{MAPE}}, \code{\link{sMAPE}} or \code{\link{MAXError}}), or as a fitness criteria (such as \code{\link{AIC}}, \code{\link{AICc}}, \code{\link{BIC}} or \code{\link{logLik}}). In the former case, the candidate models are used for time series prediction and the error measures are calculated by means of a cross-validation process. In the latter case, the candidate models are fitted and fitness criteria are calculated based on all observations in \code{timeseries}.

If \code{rank.by} is set as \code{"errors"} or \code{"fitness"}, the candidate models are ranked by all the mentioned prediction error measures or fitness criteria, respectively. The wheight of the ranking criteria is equally distributed. In this case, a \code{rank.position.sum} criterion is produced for ranking the candidate models. The \code{rank.position.sum} criterion is calculated as the sum of the rank positions of a model (1 = 1st position = better ranked model, 2 = 2nd position, etc.) on each calculated ranking criteria.
