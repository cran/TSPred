\title{Automatic ARIMA fitting and prediction with Kalman filter 
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The function predicts and returns the next n consecutive values of a univariate time series using the best evaluated ARIMA model automatically fitted with Kalman filter. It also evaluates the fitness of the produced model, using AICc, AIC, BIC and logLik criteria, and its prediction accuracy, using the MSE, NMSE, MAPE, sMAPE and maximal error accuracy measures.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
fittestArimaKF(timeseries, timeseries.test, na.action = na.omit,
se.fit = FALSE, filtered = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{timeseries}{A vector or univariate time series which contains the values used for fitting an ARIMA model with Kalman filter.
%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries} here~~
}
  \item{timeseries.test}{A vector or univariate time series containing a continuation for \code{timeseries} with actual values. The number of consecutive values to be predicted is assumed to be equal to the length of \code{timeseries.test}. It is used as a testing set and base for calculation of prediction error measures.
%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries.cont} here~~
}
  \item{na.action}{A function for treating missing values in \code{timeseries} and \code{timeseries.test}. The default function is \code{\link{na.omit}}, which omits any missing values found in \code{timeseries} or \code{timeseries.test}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{na.action} here~~
}
  \item{se.fit}{If \code{se.fit} is \code{TRUE}, the standard errors of the predictions are returned.
%%     ~~Describe \code{se.fit} here~~
}
  \item{filtered}{If \code{filtered} is \code{TRUE}, Kalman filtered time series observations are used for prediction, otherwise, Kalman smoothed observations are used for prediction.
%%     ~~Describe \code{filtered} here~~
}

\details{A best ARIMA model is automatically fitted by the \code{\link{auto.arima}} function in the \code{forecast} package. The coefficients of this model are then used as initial parameters for optimization of a state space model (\code{\link{SSModel}}) using the Kalman filter and functions of the \code{KFAS} package (see \code{\link{SSMarima}} and \code{\link{artransform}}). A set of different ARIMA state space models is generated by different initial parameterization during the model optimization process.

The generated models are used for time series prediction. Fitness measures (AICc, AIC, BIC, log-likelihood) and prediction accuracy measures (MSE, NMSE, MAPE, sMAPE, maximal error) are calculated for each model.

The models are ranked and the best evaluated fitted ARIMA model is selected based on the lowest value of the TSPredC criterion.

The TSPredC criterion is calculated as the sum of the rank possitions of a model (1 = 1st position = better ranked model, 2 = 2nd position, etc.) on each calculated fitness or prediction accuracy measure.
