\details{The NN5 Competition's Dataset A contains 111 different daily time series. Each of these time series possesses 735 observations, and may present missing data. The time series also show different patterns of single or multiple overlying seasonal properties.
Each competitor in NN5 was asked to predict the next 56 corresponding observations of each times series (\code{\link{NN5.A.cont}}).
The performance evaluation done by NN5 Competition was based on the mean SMAPE error of prediction found by the competitors across all time series.
