\title{Automatic prediction with empirical mode decomposition
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
The function automatically applies an empirical mode decomposition to a provided univariate time series. The resulting components of the decomposed series are used as base for predicting and returning the next n consecutive values of the provided univariate time series using also automatically fitted models (VAR and polynomial regression). It also evaluates fitness and prediction accuracy of the produced models.

\details{The function produces an empirical mode decomposition of \code{timeseries}. See the \code{\link[EMD]{emd}} function. The IMF's and residue series resulting from the decomposition are separately used as base for model fitting and prediction. The IMF's are fitted and predicted using a \code{\link[vars]{VAR}} model. The residue series is fitted and predicted using a polynomial regression model provided by \code{\link{fittestPolyR}}. The set of predictions for all IMF's and residue series are then reversed transformed in order to produce the next \code{h} consecutive values of the provided univariate time series in \code{timeseries}. See the \code{\link[EMD]{emd.pred}} function.

If \code{length(boundary)>1} or \code{boundary=NULL}, it is automatically selected. For that, a set of empirical mode decompositions with different options of boundary condition is generated and used for model fitting and prediction. Also, the function automatically selects the meaningful IMF's of a decomposition. For that, the function produces \code{\link[vars]{VAR}} models for different selections of meaningful IMF's according to the possible intervals \code{i:nimf} for \code{i=1,...,(nimf-1)}, where \code{nimf} is the number of IMF's in a decomposition. The options of \code{boundary} and/or meaningful IMF's of a decomposition which generate the best ranked model fitness/predictions acoording to the criteria in \code{rank.by} are selected.

The ranking criteria in \code{rank.by} may be set as a prediction error measure (such as \code{\link{MSE}}, \code{\link{NMSE}}, \code{\link{MAPE}}, \code{\link{sMAPE}} or \code{\link{MAXError}}), or as a fitness criteria (such as \code{\link{AIC}}, \code{\link{AICc}}, \code{\link{BIC}} or \code{\link{logLik}}). In the former case, the candidate empirical mode decompositions are used for time series prediction and the error measures are calculated by means of a cross-validation process. In the latter case, the component series of the candidate decompositions are modeled and model fitness criteria are calculated based on all observations in \code{timeseries}. In particular, the fitness criteria calculated for ranking the candidate decompositions correspond to the \code{\link[vars]{VAR}} models produced for the IMF's.

If \code{rank.by} is set as \code{"errors"} or \code{"fitness"}, the candidate decompositions are ranked by all the mentioned prediction error measures or fitness criteria, respectively. The wheight of the ranking criteria is equally distributed. In this case, a \code{rank.position.sum} criterion is produced for ranking the candidate decompositions. The \code{rank.position.sum} criterion is calculated as the sum of the rank positions of a decomposition (1 = 1st position = better ranked model, 2 = 2nd position, etc.) on each calculated ranking criteria.
