\description{These functions are deprecated, and may be defunct as soon as the next release.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
arimapar(timeseries, na.action = na.omit, xreg = NULL)
marimapar(timeseries, na.action=na.omit, xreg=NULL)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{timeseries}{A vector or univariate time series which contains the values used for fitting an ARIMA model.
%%     ~~Describe \code{timeseries} here~~
}
  \item{na.action}{A function for treating missing values in \code{timeseries}. The default function is \code{\link{na.omit}}, which omits any missing values found in \code{timeseries}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{na.action} here~~
}
  \item{xreg}{A vector, matrix, data frame or times series of external regressors used for fitting the ARIMA model.  It must have the same length as \code{timeseries}. Ignored if \code{NULL}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{xreg} here~~
}
}
\details{The deprecated function \code{arimapar} returns the parameters of an automatically fitted ARIMA model, including non-seasonal and seasonal orders and drift. The ARIMA model whose adjusted parameters are presented is automatically fitted by the \code{\link{auto.arima}} function in the forecast package. In order to avoid drift errors, the function introduces an auxiliary regressor whose values are a sequence of consecutive integer numbers starting from 1.
For more details, see the \code{\link{auto.arima}} function in the \code{forecast} package.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{A list giving the number of AR, MA, seasonal AR and seasonal MA coefficients, plus the period and the number of non-seasonal and seasonal differences of the automatically fitted ARIMA model. The value of the fitted drift constant is also presented.
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
